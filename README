The library does the magic. Include a few lines in your HTML head section, and you're ready to go.

Put this in your <head> section:
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="roundcorners.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="roundcorners.css"></link>


Add class="round" to a div in your HTML:


<div class="round">
  <h2>..</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>..</li>
    ..
  </ul>
</div>
